## Abstract
Public mobility sharing systems are an important component of sustainable urban transportation, particularly for last-mile travel. Analyzing user behavior and trip patterns on public data is challenging due to rotating vehicle identifiers in open data standards such as GBFS. This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict trip destinations under these constraints, enabling the reconstruction of travel patterns without relying on persistent identifiers.

We develop a three-step prediction pipeline: (1) candidate generation and reduction using spatial-temporal filtering, (2) multi-target regression via XGBoost to estimate destination coordinates, and (3) selection of the closest matching candidate from the reduced set. We evaluate the approach using data from two public mobility operators across five German cities between April 2023 and May 2025. The model achieves up to 86\% accuracy within a 500-meter tolerance and 77\%. We further validate generalization across five additional datasets. Compared to existing approaches, our method improves prediction accuracy by up to 30\% over methods that do not use user-specific features and by up to 10\% over those that do, while halving the required tolerance radius.

These results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate destination prediction in shared mobility systems despite anonymized vehicle identifiers, supporting improved system analysis and planning.
